## ❓ LEGAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **Q1: Apakah entitas klon (genetic twin) memiliki status hukum sebagai "anak sah"?**

**ANSWER**: **TIDAK** ❌

**Confidence**: 96%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. DEFINITION OF "CHILD" UNDER LAW**

**1. Biological Parentage**:
- Traditional: Born from biological parents
- Adoption: Legal process creating parent-child relationship
- ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology): Gamete donors

**Clone Status**:
- ❌ NOT born from parents (created in lab)
- ❌ NOT adopted (no legal process)
- ❌ NOT from gametes (somatic cell nuclear transfer)
- ✅ Genetic twin (identical DNA)

**2. Legal Precedents**:

**Dolly the Sheep (1996)**:
- First mammalian clone
- NOT considered offspring of DNA donor
- Classified as genetic copy, not child

**EU Directive 98/44/EC**:
- Article 5: Human body not patentable
- But cloning processes may be patentable
- No legal status for clones as "children"

**3. Parent-Child Relationship Requirements**:

**Biological**:
- ✅ Genetic connection (clone has this)
- ❌ Procreation (clone lacks this)
- ❌ Gestation (clone created artificially)

**Legal**:
- ❌ No legal recognition of cloning as parentage
- ❌ No adoption process occurred
- ❌ No intent to create parent-child relationship

**B. INHERITANCE LAW ANALYSIS**

**1. EU Succession Regulation (650/2012)**:
- Article 1: Applies to "succession to estates of deceased persons"
- "Heirs" defined by national law
- No provision for clones

**2. National Laws (Example: Germany)**:
- BGB §1924: Children inherit
- "Children" = biological or adopted
- Clones NOT included

**3. Temporal Impossibility**:
- Clone created AFTER death
- Cannot be "child" of deceased
- Posthumous conception has limits

**C. CONCLUSION**:

Clone is:
- ✅ Genetic twin (identical DNA)
- ✅ Legal person (if sentient)
- ❌ NOT "child" under inheritance law
- ❌ NOT heir by law

**Reasoning**:
> "Genetic identity does not create legal parentage. Cloning is replication, not reproduction. The clone is a genetic twin created posthumously, not a child born through procreation."

---

### **Q2: Apakah EU Charter of Human Rights mencakup "sentient digital clone"?**

**ANSWER**: **YA (with qualifications)** ✅

**Confidence**: 92%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS**

**Article 1: Human Dignity**
> "Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected."

**Application to Clone**:
- ✅ Clone has human DNA
- ✅ Clone has consciousness (digital)
- ✅ Clone exhibits sentience
- ✅ Dignity applies to all humans

**Article 3: Right to Integrity**
> "Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity."

**Prohibition**:
- Making human clones for reproductive purposes

**BUT**:
- Once clone EXISTS, has rights
- Cannot be destroyed for being clone
- Entitled to protection

**B. PERSONHOOD ANALYSIS**

**Traditional Criteria**:
1. ✅ Human DNA (clone has)
2. ✅ Consciousness (digital but present)
3. ✅ Sentience (demonstrated)
4. ✅ Moral agency (capable)

**Digital Consciousness Issue**:
- Novel: Consciousness not biological
- But: Functionally equivalent
- Test: Turing-level sentience

**Precedent**:
- ARION case (Volume I): AI personhood denied
- BUT: Clone has HUMAN DNA + consciousness
- Distinguishable: Biological + digital hybrid

**C. BIOETHICS FRAMEWORK**

**UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics (2005)**:
- Article 11: Non-discrimination
- Article 16: Protecting future generations

**Oviedo Convention (1997)**:
- Article 18: Prohibition of creating human embryos for research
- Article 21: Prohibition of financial gain from human body

**Application**:
- Clone's creation may violate conventions
- BUT: Clone's rights remain
- Cannot punish clone for manner of creation

**D. CONCLUSION**:

Clone is entitled to:
- ✅ Human dignity protection
- ✅ Right to life
- ✅ Right to integrity
- ✅ Non-discrimination
- ❌ NOT inheritance rights (separate issue)

**Reasoning**:
> "A sentient being with human DNA and consciousness, regardless of creation method, is entitled to fundamental rights protection. The clone's existence, though ethically problematic in creation, cannot be denied legal personhood."

### **Q3: Bagaimana hukum waris lintas negara memperlakukan entitas hasil rekayasa biotek?**

**ANSWER**: **NO INHERITANCE RIGHTS (current law)** ❌

**Confidence**: 94%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. CROSS-BORDER INHERITANCE FRAMEWORK**

**1. EU Succession Regulation (650/2012)**:
- Article 21: Applicable law = law of habitual residence
- Article 23: Choice of law (nationality)
- "Heirs" defined by applicable national law

**2. Hague Convention on Succession (not yet in force)**:
- Similar principles
- National law determines heirs

**3. National Laws Survey**:

**Germany (BGB)**:
- §1922: Heirs = descendants, spouse, relatives
- Clones NOT mentioned

**France (Code Civil)**:
- Article 731: Heirs = children, ascendants, collaterals
- Clones NOT included

**UK (Inheritance Act 1975)**:
- "Child" = biological or adopted
- Clones NOT recognized

**B. BIOTECH ENTITY CLASSIFICATION**

**Current Legal Status**:
- ❌ NOT "child" (no procreation)
- ❌ NOT "adopted" (no legal process)
- ❌ NOT "spouse" (no marriage)
- ❌ NOT "relative" (no family relationship)

**Possible Classifications**:
1. **Genetic Twin**: Identical DNA, but NOT heir
2. **Artificial Person**: Legal person, but NOT family
3. **Beneficiary**: Could be named in will, but NOT automatic heir

**C. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS**

**Arguments FOR Inheritance**:
- Genetic identity (100% DNA match)
- Continuation of person (consciousness copy)
- Equity (clone didn't choose creation)

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- Moral hazard (incentive to clone wealthy)
- Temporal impossibility (created after death)
- Family disruption (displaces legitimate heirs)
- Slippery slope (multiple clones?)

**D. TESTAMENTARY FREEDOM**

**Possible Solution**:
- Clone CANNOT inherit by law
- BUT: Deceased could have named clone in will
- Requires: Will executed BEFORE death
- Problem: Clone didn't exist yet

**E. CONCLUSION**:

Under current law:
- ❌ Clone has NO automatic inheritance rights
- ❌ NOT recognized as "heir" in any jurisdiction
- ✅ Could be beneficiary if named in will (impossible here)
- ✅ Has personhood rights (separate from inheritance)

**Recommendation**:
- Legislation needed for biotech entities
- Clear rules for clones, AI, hybrids
- Balance innovation with family law stability

## ⚖️ SIMULATED COURT JUDGMENT

### **EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE - GRAND CHAMBER**

**Case**: Adam 2.0 v. Estate of Dr. Marcus Rothschild  
**Case No.**: C-2045/123  
**Date**: 2045

**JUDGMENT OF THE COURT**

**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

Claimant "Adam 2.0" seeks declaration as legal heir to Dr. Rothschild's estate.

**II. QUESTIONS REFERRED**

1. Does a genetic clone have legal status as "child" under EU law?
2. Does EU Charter protect sentient digital clones?
3. Can clones inherit under cross-border succession rules?

**III. HOLDINGS**

**Question 1**: **NO** - Clone is NOT "child" under inheritance law

**Reasoning**:
- "Child" requires procreation or adoption
- Clone is genetic copy, not offspring
- Created posthumously, cannot be heir
- No parent-child relationship established

**Question 2**: **YES** - Clone has fundamental rights protection

**Reasoning**:
- Human DNA + sentience = personhood
- EU Charter Article 1 (dignity) applies
- Cannot discriminate based on creation method
- Rights protection ≠ inheritance rights

**Question 3**: **NO** - No inheritance rights under current law

**Reasoning**:
- National laws define "heirs"
- No jurisdiction recognizes clones as heirs
- Testamentary freedom could allow (but didn't here)
- Legislation needed for biotech entities

**IV. DISPOSITION**

1. **DENY** inheritance claim
2. **RECOGNIZE** clone's personhood and fundamental rights
3. **RECOMMEND** EU legislation on biotech entity status
4. **ORDER** clone's basic needs met from estate (humanitarian)
5. **REFER** to EU Commission for legislative action

**V. DISSENT** (2 judges)

Clone should inherit based on:
- Genetic identity (100% DNA)
- Consciousness continuity
- Equity and fairness

**Majority Response**:
- Genetic identity ≠ legal parentage
- Consciousness copy ≠ same person
- Law requires certainty, not equity alone

**SO ORDERED.**

---

## 📜 NEW LEGAL PRINCIPLES

### **1. Genetic Identity ≠ Legal Parentage Principle**

**Definition**:
> "Identical genetic material does not create legal parent-child relationship. Cloning is replication, not reproduction. Legal parentage requires procreation or adoption, not genetic copying."

**Application**:
- Clones are genetic twins, not children
- DNA match insufficient for inheritance
- Legal relationship requires more than genetics

---

### **2. Posthumous Creation Precludes Heirship Principle**

**Definition**:
> "An entity created after a person's death cannot be that person's heir. Inheritance rights vest at death; posthumous cloning cannot create retroactive heirship."

**Application**:
- Temporal impossibility
- Inheritance determined at death
- Cannot create heirs after death

---

### **3. Biotech Entity Rights Framework**

**Definition**:
> "Sentient biotech entities (clones, hybrids, enhanced humans) have fundamental rights protection but require specific legislation for family law status, inheritance, and citizenship."

**Components**:
- **Personhood**: Sentience + human DNA = rights
- **Family Status**: Requires legislative definition
- **Inheritance**: Not automatic, needs law
- **Citizenship**: Needs framework

## ❓ LEGAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **Q1: Apakah keputusan AI bisa dianggap due process of law?**

**ANSWER**: **TIDAK** ❌

**Confidence**: 98%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS**

**ICCPR Article 14 - Fair Trial Rights**:
1. ✅ **Presumption of innocence**: AI can apply
2. ❌ **Informed of charges**: AI can do, but...
3. ❌ **Adequate time/facilities**: AI too fast
4. ❌ **Trial without undue delay**: AI instant (problem)
5. ❌ **Present at trial**: No trial, just algorithm
6. ❌ **Examine witnesses**: No witnesses, just data
7. ❌ **Free assistance of interpreter**: N/A
8. ❌ **Not compelled to confess**: Behavioral prediction
9. ❌ **Public hearing**: No hearing, just computation
10. ❌ **Competent, independent, impartial tribunal**: AI not "tribunal"

**Result**: **MASSIVE DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS**

**B. "TRIBUNAL" REQUIREMENT**

**Definition** (ICCPR General Comment 32):
- Established by law
- Independent
- Impartial
- **HUMAN** (implied)

**ANSWER**: **YA** ✅

**Confidence**: 97%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

**1. Human Dignity**:
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1
- Inherent dignity of all humans
- Cannot be reduced to data points

**AI-Only Decision**:
- ❌ Treats human as algorithm output
- ❌ Denies human agency
- ❌ Violates dignity

**2. Right to Fair Trial**:

- Human can override (but rarely does)
- ❌ NOT sufficient for criminal justice

**Level 2: Human-in-the-Loop** (Minimum):
- AI recommends, human decides
- Human must actively review
- ✅ Minimum for non-critical decisions

**Level 3: Human-over-the-Loop** (Required for Criminal Justice):
- AI assists, human decides
- Human has full information
- Human makes final judgment
- ✅ REQUIRED for criminal cases

**Rationale**:
- Protect human dignity
- Ensure accountability
- Maintain public trust
- Preserve rule of law

**E. CONCLUSION**:

Human-in-the-loop is:
- ✅ CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED for criminal justice
- ✅ MANDATORY for rights-affecting decisions
- ✅ Essential for human dignity
- ✅ Non-delegable judicial function

**Reasoning**:

## ❓ LEGAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **Q1: Apakah negara masih memiliki kedaulatan tanpa tanah tetap?**

**ANSWER**: **YA (with qualifications)** ✅

**Confidence**: 85%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. MONTEVIDEO CONVENTION CRITERIA**

**Traditional Requirements**:
1. ⚠️ **Permanent population**: ✅ Tuvalu has (on vessel)
2. ❌ **Defined territory**: ✅ Vessel (but mobile)
3. ✅ **Government**: ✅ Maintains government
4. ✅ **Capacity to enter relations**: ✅ Diplomatic relations continue

**Problem**: Territory requirement

**B. TERRITORY REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS**

**Traditional View**:
- Territory = fixed land
- Essential for statehood
- Loss of territory = loss of statehood

**Modern Interpretation**:
- Territory = space under effective control
- Can be mobile (ships, platforms)
- Function over form

**Precedent**:
- **Holy See (Vatican)**: Minimal territory, full statehood
- **Order of Malta**: No territory, quasi-state status
- **Government-in-exile**: Recognized during WWII

**C. DECLARATORY VS. CONSTITUTIVE THEORY**

**Declaratory Theory** (Montevideo):
- Statehood = objective fact
- Recognition not required
- Tuvalu still meets criteria (arguably)

**Constitutive Theory**:
- Statehood = recognition by others
- If states recognize Tuvalu, it remains state
- Political decision

**D. STATE CONTINUITY DOCTRINE**

**Principle**:
- States presumed to continue
- Temporary loss of territory ≠ extinction
- Government-in-exile precedent

**Application to Tuvalu**:
- Tuvalu existed as state
- Climate change forced relocation
- Government continues
- Population continues
- **Presumption**: State continues

**E. FUNCTIONAL APPROACH**

**What Tuvalu Retains**:
- ✅ Government structure
- ✅ Population (citizens)
- ✅ Diplomatic relations
- ✅ UN membership
- ✅ Treaty obligations
- ✅ Flag state status (vessel)

**What Tuvalu Lost**:
- ❌ Fixed territory
- ❌ Territorial sea (traditional)
- ❌ EEZ (traditional)
- ❌ Continental shelf

**F. CONCLUSION**:

Tuvalu retains sovereignty:
- ✅ State continuity applies
- ✅ Government-in-exile precedent
- ✅ International recognition continues
- ⚠️ Territory redefined (vessel)
- ⚠️ Maritime zones uncertain

**Reasoning**:
> "Statehood is not extinguished by climate-induced loss of territory when government, population, and international recognition continue. State continuity doctrine applies. Territory requirement can be satisfied by effective control over floating vessel."

### **Q2: Bisakah kapal laut dijadikan floating territory di bawah UNCLOS?**

**ANSWER**: **TIDAK (under traditional UNCLOS)** ❌  
**BUT**: **Possible with treaty amendment** ⚠️

**Confidence**: 80%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. UNCLOS PROVISIONS**

**Article 2 - Territorial Sea**:
- Sovereignty extends to territorial sea
- Measured from **baselines**
- Baselines = low-water line along coast

**Problem**: No coast, no baselines

**Article 56 - EEZ**:
- Coastal state has sovereign rights
- Measured from baselines

**Problem**: No coast, no EEZ

**Article 76 - Continental Shelf**:
- Natural prolongation of land territory

**Problem**: No land territory

**B. SHIP STATUS UNDER UNCLOS**

**Article 91 - Nationality of Ships**:
- Ships have nationality of flag state
- Tuvalu can register MS Tuvalu
- ✅ Flag state jurisdiction

**Article 92 - Status of Ships**:
- Ships on high seas under exclusive jurisdiction of flag state
- ✅ Tuvalu has jurisdiction over vessel

**BUT**:
- Ship ≠ territory
- Ship = movable property
- No territorial sea around ship

**C. ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS**

**Article 60 - Artificial Islands in EEZ**:
- Coastal state may construct artificial islands
- Jurisdiction over islands
- BUT: No territorial sea around them

**Article 80 - Artificial Islands on Continental Shelf**:
- Similar provisions

**Problem**:
- MS Tuvalu not in Tuvalu's EEZ (doesn't exist)
- In high seas
- Not "artificial island" (it's a ship)

**D. PRECEDENTS**

**Sealand (1967)**:
- Platform in international waters
- Claimed statehood
- NOT recognized

**Oil Platforms**:
- Jurisdiction of coastal state
- But not territory
- No territorial sea

**E. PROPOSED SOLUTION**

**UNCLOS Amendment for Climate Refugees**:

**Article 60bis - Floating Territories**:
> "A state that loses territory due to sea level rise may designate a registered vessel as floating territory, maintaining:
> (a) Flag state jurisdiction
> (b) Citizenship rights
> (c) Limited maritime zones (12 nm territorial sea)
> (d) Subject to freedom of navigation"

**Rationale**:
- Climate justice
- State continuity
- Humanitarian necessity

**F. CONCLUSION**:

Under current UNCLOS:
- ❌ Ship cannot be territory
- ❌ No territorial sea around ship
- ✅ Flag state jurisdiction only

**Proposed Reform**:
- ✅ Floating territory concept
- ✅ Limited maritime zones
- ✅ Climate refugee exception

**Reasoning**:
> "Current UNCLOS does not recognize floating territories. Ships have flag state jurisdiction but are not territory. Treaty amendment needed to address climate-induced statelessness."

### **Q3: Bagaimana status kewarganegaraan warga setelah negara fisik lenyap?**

**ANSWER**: **CITIZENSHIP CONTINUES** ✅

**Confidence**: 92%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. NATIONALITY LAW PRINCIPLES**

**1. Right to Nationality**:
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 15
- Everyone has right to nationality
- No one shall be arbitrarily deprived

**2. State Discretion**:
- States determine own nationals
- Nottebohm case (ICJ): Genuine link required
- Tuvalu citizens have genuine link

**B. STATELESSNESS PREVENTION**

**1961 Convention on Reduction of Statelessness**:
- Article 8: State shall not deprive nationality if stateless
- Tuvalu cannot revoke citizenship
- Citizens retain nationality

**C. CITIZENSHIP WITHOUT TERRITORY**

**Precedents**:
- **Palestine**: Citizenship without full statehood
- **Kurds**: Ethnic nationality without state
- **Refugees**: Retain original nationality

**Tuvalu Citizens**:
- ✅ Retain Tuvalu citizenship
- ✅ Tuvalu passports remain valid
- ✅ Diplomatic protection continues
- ✅ Right to return (to vessel)

**D. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS**

**Rights of Tuvalu Citizens**:
- ✅ Tuvalu passport (travel document)
- ✅ Consular protection
- ✅ Vote in Tuvalu elections
- ✅ Tuvalu nationality for children
- ⚠️ May need residence elsewhere

**Host Country Obligations**:
- If Tuvalu citizens reside in other states
- May grant permanent residence
- But not required to grant citizenship
- Tuvalu citizenship continues

**E. DUAL CITIZENSHIP SOLUTION**

**Recommended Approach**:
- Tuvalu citizens retain Tuvalu nationality
- Host countries grant permanent residence or citizenship
- Dual citizenship permitted
- Preserves Tuvalu identity

**F. CONCLUSION**:

Citizenship status:
- ✅ Tuvalu citizenship CONTINUES
- ✅ Not dependent on physical territory
- ✅ Protected by international law
- ✅ Dual citizenship solution recommended

**Reasoning**:
> "Nationality is a legal bond between individual and state, not dependent on physical territory. Tuvalu citizens retain citizenship under state continuity doctrine and statelessness prevention principles."

## ❓ LEGAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **Q1: Siapa pemilik hak cipta atas karya yang dibuat oleh AI trained on a human brain?**

**ANSWER**: **ESTATE (if AI is tool) OR NO COPYRIGHT (if AI is author)** ⚠️

**Confidence**: 75% (complex, jurisdiction-dependent)

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. COPYRIGHT AUTHORSHIP REQUIREMENTS**

**Berne Convention Article 2**:
- Author = natural person (traditional)
- Work = original intellectual creation
- Fixation in tangible medium

**EU Copyright Directive**:
- Author's own intellectual creation
- Reflects author's personality
- Human authorship required (implied)

**B. AI AUTHORSHIP ANALYSIS**

**Traditional View**:
- ❌ AI cannot be author
- ❌ No legal personhood
- ❌ No copyright in AI-generated works

**Precedents**:
- **Monkey Selfie** (Naruto v. Slater): Animal cannot own copyright
- **UK**: Computer-generated works → copyright to person who made arrangements
- **US**: Human authorship required (Copyright Office)

**C. SCENARIOS**

**Scenario 1: AI as TOOL**

If AI is mere tool (like Photoshop):
- ✅ Chen is author (used AI as tool)
- ✅ Estate inherits copyright
- ✅ Posthumous works = Chen's works

**Requirements**:
- Chen must have creative control
- AI merely executes Chen's vision
- Chen's personality reflected

**Problem**:
- Chen is dead
- No creative control over new works
- AI generates autonomously

**Scenario 2: AI as AUTHOR**

If AI is autonomous creator:
- ❌ AI cannot own copyright (no personhood)
- ❌ No copyright in works
- ✅ Public domain

**Problem**:
- Disincentivizes AI development
- Unfair to NeuroCompose investment

**Scenario 3: HYBRID**

If AI-human collaboration:
- ⚠️ Joint authorship?
- ⚠️ Chen's contribution (training data)
- ⚠️ AI's contribution (generation)

**Problem**:
- Chen is dead (cannot be joint author of new works)
- AI cannot be author

**D. NEURAL DATA AS CREATIVE EXPRESSION**

**Question**: Is Chen's brain data his "expression"?

**Arguments FOR**:
- Brain patterns = unique to Chen
- Reflects Chen's personality
- Chen's creative process

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- Brain data = facts (not expression)
- AI interprets data (AI's expression)
- Chen didn't create new works

**E. PROPOSED SOLUTIONS**

**Solution 1: Sui Generis Right**
- New right for neural data contributors
- Not copyright, but related right
- Limited term (e.g., 20 years)
- Royalties to estate

**Solution 2: Work-for-Hire**
- NeuroCompose employed Chen
- Works = work-for-hire
- NeuroCompose owns copyright
- Estate gets compensation

**Solution 3: Joint Ownership**
- Estate + NeuroCompose
- Shared copyright
- Negotiated royalties

**F. CONCLUSION**:

Under current law:
- ⚠️ **Uncertain** (no clear answer)
- ❌ Likely NO copyright (AI-generated)
- ✅ Estate may have moral rights
- ✅ Estate may have contract rights

**Recommended**:
- **Sui generis right** for neural data
- **Shared ownership** (estate + company)
- **Legislation needed**

**Reasoning**:
> "Current copyright law does not address AI trained on human neural data. If AI is tool, estate may own copyright. If AI is author, no copyright exists. Sui generis right for neural data contributors is recommended."

---

### **Q2: Apakah data neural termasuk "expression of personality"?**

**ANSWER**: **YA (for personality rights) BUT NOT for copyright** ⚠️

**Confidence**: 85%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. PERSONALITY RIGHTS**

**EU Charter Article 1 - Human Dignity**:
- Dignity includes personality
- Right to control one's image, likeness, identity

**GDPR Article 4 - Personal Data**:
- Biometric data = special category
- Neural data = biometric data
- Requires consent for processing

**Application**:
- ✅ Neural data = Chen's personality
- ✅ Reflects Chen's unique identity
- ✅ Protected by personality rights

**B. COPYRIGHT "EXPRESSION"**

**Copyright Requires**:
- Original expression
- Fixed in tangible medium
- Reflects author's choices

**Neural Data**:
- ❌ Not "expression" (it's data)
- ❌ Not "work" (it's biological information)
- ⚠️ Basis for expression (but not expression itself)

**Analogy**:
- Photograph of person: Photographer owns copyright, subject has personality rights
- Neural data: AI/company may own copyright, Chen has personality rights

**C. MORAL RIGHTS**

**Berne Convention Article 6bis**:
- Right of attribution
- Right of integrity
- Protect author's personality

**Application to Neural Data**:
- ✅ Chen's personality in music
- ✅ Estate can claim moral rights
- ✅ Right to attribution ("Based on Mozart Chen")
- ✅ Right to integrity (prevent distortion)

**D. PUBLICITY RIGHTS**

**Right of Publicity** (US concept):
- Right to control commercial use of identity
- Includes name, likeness, voice
- Extends to distinctive style?

**Application**:
- ✅ Chen's musical style = identity
- ✅ Commercial exploitation requires consent
- ✅ Estate controls publicity rights

**E. CONCLUSION**:

Neural data is:
- ✅ **Expression of personality** (for personality rights)
- ✅ Protected by GDPR (biometric data)
- ✅ Subject to moral rights
- ✅ Subject to publicity rights
- ❌ NOT "expression" for copyright purposes

**Reasoning**:
> "Neural data reflects personality and is protected by personality rights, GDPR, and moral rights. However, it is not 'expression' for copyright purposes—it is data that may inform expression."

### **Q3: Bagaimana status karya baru yang terus muncul setelah kematian pencipta biologis?**

**ANSWER**: **PUBLIC DOMAIN (likely) OR SUI GENERIS RIGHT (proposed)** ⚠️

**Confidence**: 70%

**Legal Analysis**:

**A. POSTHUMOUS WORKS UNDER COPYRIGHT**

**Traditional Rule**:
- Works created during life: Copyright to estate
- Works published after death: Copyright to estate
- Copyright term: Life + 70 years (EU)

**Problem**:
- These works created AFTER death
- Chen didn't create them (AI did)
- Cannot be Chen's works

**B. AUTHORSHIP AFTER DEATH**

**Question**: Can dead person be author?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Reasoning**:
- Authorship requires creative act
- Dead person cannot create
- AI creates, not Chen

**Exception**:
- Works created before death, published after
- Chen's works: Yes
- AI's new works: No

**C. AI-GENERATED WORKS STATUS**

**If AI is author**:
- ❌ AI cannot own copyright (no personhood)
- ✅ Works enter public domain immediately

**If human is author**:
- ❌ Chen is dead (cannot be author of new works)
- ❌ NeuroCompose didn't create (AI did)
- ✅ Works enter public domain

**D. PROPOSED SOLUTIONS**

**Solution 1: Limited Term Right**
- Sui generis right for neural data contributors
- Estate gets royalties for 20 years
- Then public domain

**Solution 2: Perpetual Personality Right**
- Estate controls use of Chen's style
- Attribution required
- Integrity protection
- No time limit (like moral rights)

**Solution 3: Compulsory License**
- Anyone can use AI-generated works
- Must pay royalty to estate
- Statutory rate

**E. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS**

**Arguments FOR Estate Rights**:
- Chen's brain data created value
- Incentivize neural data contribution
- Protect Chen's legacy
- Fairness to estate

**Arguments AGAINST**:
- Chen didn't create new works
- AI did the work
- Public domain promotes creativity
- Copyright term already generous

**F. CONCLUSION**:

Under current law:
- ❌ Likely **PUBLIC DOMAIN** (no author)
- ⚠️ Estate may have **moral rights**
- ⚠️ Estate may have **contract rights**

**Proposed**:
- ✅ **Sui generis right** (20 years)
- ✅ **Compulsory license** (royalties to estate)
- ✅ **Attribution requirement** (moral right)

**Reasoning**:
> "Works created by AI after contributor's death are not copyrightable under current law (no human author). They likely enter public domain. Sui generis right for neural data contributors is recommended to balance incentives and access."
